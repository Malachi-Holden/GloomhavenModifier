# Attack modifier deck helper app

If you haven't played the great board game (Gloomhaven)[https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/174430/gloomhaven] then go buy it, play it, and we'll pick up from there.

If you've played it, you know how much of a headache it is to shuffle your attack modifiers, to add and remove perks. What if you didn't shuffle fairly? Is that why you got the null 3 times in a row???

Gloomhaven Modifier is an android app to track all this for you. You can customize a character sheet and get playing. Add curses, blesses, draw, and reshuffle. It lets you focus on the game instead of messing with cards!
